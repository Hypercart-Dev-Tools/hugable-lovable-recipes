**Project:** Lovable AI Architecture & Documentation Framework
**Focus:** Checklist-driven architecture, multi-tenant isolation, dev testing patterns, and SEO for React SPAs.

# 4x4 Dashboard - Strategic Goals & Weekly Checklist
A simple, actionable framework to prioritize and track engineering tasks. Focus on alignment, transparency, continuous improvement, and increasing clarity for everyone. This document does not replace your project management tools. It is meant to be a simple, actionable checklist to help you focus on the most important tasks for the week.

# About the Current Project
**hug2love-recipes** is a living architecture documentation system for Lovable AI projects (React/Vite/Supabase). It provides:
- **AGENTS.md**: Canonical architecture rules and checklists (v1.6.3)
- **DASHBOARD.md**: Build cycle compliance matrix and architecture snapshot
- **QUICKHELP.md**: First-layer help and FAQ for common tasks
- **OFF-ROAD/** guides: Advanced patterns (Supabase temp dev sandbox, React SPA SEO)
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Version history and lessons learned

---

## 1. Strategic Backlog
**Maximum of 4 items. Focus on long-term goals and impactful improvements.**
Long-term initiatives to improve architecture documentation, developer experience, and framework adoption.

1. - [ ] **Audit & Refactor Sloppy Codebases** - Detect parallel pipelines and state-tracking issues; recommend systematic refactoring (AGENTS.md §0.2)
2. - [ ] SEO static home page conversion - in progress
3. - [ ] **AI Agent Memory System** - Implement persistent memory for AI agents to remember project context across sessions (remember tool integration)
4. - [ ] **Automated Compliance Checker** - Build CLI tool to validate AGENTS.md compliance matrix against actual codebase (RLS policies, layout patterns, state management)

---

## 2. Current Week (Week of 2026-02-09)
**Active tasks for the week. Maximum of 4 items.**

> **Status:** Week completed. All planned work delivered and documented.

- [x] **Enhance Graduation Workflow** (v1.6.3) - Expanded "Spike → Production" section with 6-step process, SQL/TypeScript/React examples, cleanup commands, verification queries, and 8-item checklist
- [x] **Reorganize Documentation Structure** (v1.6.2) - Moved SUPABASE-TEMP-DB.md to OFF-ROAD/ folder; added STATIC-HOME-PAGE.md guide for React SPA SEO; updated all cross-references
- [x] **Add AI Agent Troubleshooting Protocol** (v1.6.1) - Escalation checklist, Minimum Handoff Bundle instructions, real-world "Lovable Back-and-Forth Scenarios" troubleshooting table
- [x] **Create Supabase Dev Testing Guide** (v1.6) - Comprehensive OFF-ROAD/SUPABASE-TEMP-DB.md with feature-key scoping, dual access paths (SDK + Edge Function), and spike-to-production workflow

---

## 3. Previous Week (Week of 2026-02-02)
**Review completed, deferred, or blocked tasks from the prior week.**

- [x] **Refactor Orchestration** - Extracted Compliance Matrix and Architecture Snapshot from AGENTS.md into DASHBOARD.md; created QUICKHELP.md as first-layer help
- [x] **Create REFERENCES.md** - Source material for design principles (SOLID, DRY, state hygiene, FSM patterns)
- [x] **Add Overall Health Grade** - Introduced Grade A-F assessment system for architecture compliance (AGENTS.md §0.6)
- [x] **Lovable Supabase Debugging Guide** - Documented real-world troubleshooting scenarios and escalation patterns

---

## 4. Recent Lessons Learned
**Capture insights to improve processes and avoid repeating mistakes.**

1. **Real-World > Theoretical** - Initial Supabase sandbox documentation was theoretical. User provided actual Lovable implementation with `temp_dev_records` + `temp_dev_reset_log` tables, feature-key scoping, and dual access paths. Always validate patterns against production usage before documenting.

2. **Explicit Reminders Matter** - Users asked "do we have a reminder to clean up temp data?" Expanded graduation section from 5 bullets to 6 steps with SQL/TypeScript/React examples, cleanup commands, verification queries, and 8-item checklist. Explicit > implicit.

3. **Folder Organization Improves Discoverability** - Moving SUPABASE-TEMP-DB.md to OFF-ROAD/ folder and adding STATIC-HOME-PAGE.md guide made advanced patterns more discoverable. Separate "core architecture" from "use when needed" guides.

4. **AI Agent Instructions Enable Self-Service** - Embedding AI agent instructions in AGENTS.md (setup wizard, context awareness, troubleshooting protocol) allows AI to proactively suggest patterns and guide users through setup without human intervention.

## Bonus: Project Scope Outline

> **Note:** This section is a work-in-progress and is being developed as a natural extension of the 4x4 methodology. It is not yet a core part of the framework but is included here as a supplementary tool for teams who want to add more context to their planning.

### 1. Goals
Define the overarching objectives for the project. What are you trying to achieve?

### 2. Assumptions
List any assumptions, including low to high-end time estimates, that influence your planning.

### 3. Potential Risks
Identify risks that could impact the project and consider mitigation strategies.

### 4. Long-Term Maintainability
Evaluate how the project will be maintained over time. Are there any technical debts or sustainability concerns to address?

For detailed guidance on the 4x4 framework, see the [README](README.md).

**Quick tips:**
- Update this document weekly (move "Current Week" to "Previous Week" and plan your new week)
- Limit each section to 4 items maximum to maintain focus
- Capture lessons learned immediately while they're fresh
- Link to detailed tasks in your project management tools (GitHub, Jira, etc.)
